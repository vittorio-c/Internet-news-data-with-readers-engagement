# About

This repository is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset showing engagement counts on articles published by several medias.

Engagement is mesured on social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), with following KPI :

- `engagement_share_count`
- `engagement_comment_count`
- `engagement_reaction_count`

The EDA tries to understand what causes the best engagement KPI : lenght of the article, words used in it, signed/unsigned articles, use of impacting words such as violence or sex, etc.

The EDA made with Python/Jupyter is available [here]('./index.ipynb')

The dataset is available [here]('./articles_data.csv')
